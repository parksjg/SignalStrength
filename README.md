# SignalStrength
Work in progress for an android app that collects and stores RSRP, RSRQ, CINR, and Cell ID. 
The answers need to be as accurate as the phones hardware allows (I am testing on Samsung Galaxy S5) 
because I need to do post processing statistics with those values.

# For a newer, better version see indoorLTE3a repository.
